### R29: What is a private network address? Should a datagram with a private network address ever be present in the larger public Internet? Explain

- [RFC 1918](https://datatracker.ietf.org/doc/html/rfc1918#section-3) defines three blocks of addresses as designated for private internets. The IPs within these ranges are for smaller subnets to preserve the number of IPv4 addresses available to the wider internet. One gateway router will use a public IP to route all traffic from a network of private IPs using NAT. This allows ample smaller networks to all operate many devices using the same private IPv4 addresses. This system relies on private IP addresses staying hidden behind a gateway router because mutltiple private subnets will share private IP addresses in their local subnet and therefore a datagram with a private network address wouldn't make sense in the larger public network.

### R26: Suppose you purchase a wireless router and connect it to your cable modem. Also suppose that your ISP dynamically assigns your connected device (that is, your wireless router) one IP address. Also suppose that you have five PCs at home that use 802.11 to wirelessly connect to your wireless router. How are IP addresses assigned to the five PCs? Does the wireless router use NAT? Why or why not?

## Problems

### P15: Consider the topology shown in Figure 4.20. Denote the three subnets with hosts (starting clockwise at 12:00) as Networks A, B, and C. Denote the subnets without hosts as Networks D, E, and F. a. Assign network addresses to each of these six subnets, with the following constraints: All addresses must be allocated from 214.97.254/23; Subnet A should have enough addresses to support 250 interfaces; Subnet B should have enough addresses to support 120 interfaces; and Subnet C should have enough addresses to support 120 interfaces. Of course, subnets D, E and F should each be able to support two interfaces. For each subnet, the assignment should take the form a.b.c.d/x or a.b.c.d/x â€“ e.f.g.h/y. b. Using your answer to part (a), provide the forwarding tables (using longest prefix matching) for each of the three routers

### P16: Use the whois service at the [American Registry for Internet Numbers](http://www.arin.net/whois) to determine the IP address blocks for three universities. Can the whois services be used to determine with certainty the geographical location of a specific IP address? Use [maxmind](www.maxmind.com) to determine the locations of the Web servers at each of these universities

University of Washington
University of Notre Dame
University of Wisconsin-Madison

### P18: Consider the network setup in Figure 4.25. Suppose that the ISP instead assigns the router the address 24.34.112.235 and that the network address of the home network is 192.168.0/24. a. Assign addresses to all interfaces in the home network. b. Suppose each host has two ongoing TCP connections, all to port 80 at host 128.119.40.86. Provide the six corresponding entries in the NAT translation table

***

### P19: Suppose you are interested in detecting the number of hosts behind a NAT. You observe that the IP layer stamps an identification number sequentially on each IP packet. The identification number of the first IP packet generated by a host is a random number, and the identification numbers of the subsequent IP packets are sequentially assigned. Assume all IP packets generated by hosts behind the NAT are sent to the outside world
