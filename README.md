# MIDN 2/C Francesconi's IC322-Portfolio

I'm maintaining this Portfolio for IC322: Computer Networks. If you're visiting, you're *not* welcome! Do feel free to leave feedback by opening an issue or submitting a merge request.

Currently in debt TWO weeks. I will pay it in time. (ironically this is a good thing)


1. [Week One: The Internet](/week01/README.md)
2. [Week Two: The Application Layer](/week02/)
3. [Week Three: The Application Layer (Other than HTTP)](/week03/)
4. [Week Four: Transport Layer: TCP and UDP](/week04/)
5. [Week Five: Transport Layer](/week05/)

>Someone left feedback to add links to the different weeks here but you literally had to scroll past all of the folders labeled with the week numbers to get here so jokes on you I guess.


> Note that as I am writing this portfolio I include blockquotes to illustrate my frustration with this garbage. If you are viewing this portfolio to give me a grade please ignore any blockquotes. These are only for my personal edification. If it makes you feel any better these motivate me to work more because they give me some sense of control.
