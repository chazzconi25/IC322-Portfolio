# MIDN 2/C Francesconi's IC322-Portfolio

I'm maintaining this Portfolio for IC322: Computer Networks. If you're visiting, you're *not* welcome! Do feel free to leave feedback by opening an issue or submitting a merge request.

Currently in debt two weeks. I plan to be out of debt by Friday of this week.
