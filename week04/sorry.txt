Hi! Welcome! I am excited you have been assigned to review my portfolio.
 If it isnt obvious, I haven't done a whole lot of work for this class!
 I am quite the procrastinator. Nevertheless, I would hate for this to
 impact your ability to get work done so please just let me know you are
 trying to review this week and I will get it done and let you know as soon
 as possible! It doesn't take me more than one night to complete a week.

 I am tring to have everything done Wednesday night but I might be screwed!
 We'll see I guess...

 Deepest Apologies,
 C. R. Francesconi
