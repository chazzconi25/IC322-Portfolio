# Week Four: Transport Layer: TCP and UDP

## Learning Goals

### I can explain how TCP and UDP multiplex messages between processes using sockets.

### I can explain the difference between TCP and UDP, including the services they provide and scenarios each is better suited to.

### I can explain how and why the following mechanisms are used and which are used in TCP): sequence numbers, duplicate ACKs, timers, pipelining, go-back-N, selective repeat, sliding window.

### I can explain how these mechanisms are used to solve dropped packets, out-of-order packets, corrupted/dropped acknowledgements, and duplicate packets/acknowledgements.
