> Somone who is doing well in this class reccomended I have a readme for each week. I think that is pretty stupid considering I named my files well and you should be able to navigate files on your own without me holding your hand. Nevertheles, as we all know this is **not** a networks class but rather a ```markdown``` class so why not take the opportunity to waste more time making text nice. (This is also the reason my portfolio is now named a markdown portfolio and not a networks portfolio.)
