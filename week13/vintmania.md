### Vint Cerf is known as "one of the fathers of the Internet". Why is he known as this?

Vint Cerf is known as the "Father of the Internet" for co-designing the Transmission Control Protocol (TCP) and the Internet Protocol (IP) with Robert E. Kahn in the 1970s. These protocols, collectively known as TCP/IP, are the foundation of the Internet, enabling reliable communication between different computer networks. Cerf's pioneering work established the fundamental standards for data transmission, contributing significantly to the development of the interconnected and decentralized network architecture that defines the modern Internet. His key role in creating these protocols earned him the title in recognition of his foundational contributions to the Internet's infrastructure. (WRITTEN WITH AI AND VERFIED WITH SOURCES BELOW)

### Develop 2 interesting and insightful questions you'd like to ask him. For each question, describe why it is interesting and insightful
 
In you Ted Talk on DTM, Delay and Disruption Tolerant Protocols, you mentioned that a store and forward idea was used to transmit data from Mars to Earth. You also aknoledged that this is the same way packet switching works in the internet. Do you see any other real life situations where internet protocols and their application may solve communication or transmission problems?

This question is insightful because it acknowledges Vint Cerfs earlier work. It is interesting because it tries to draw bigger parallels between the field of computer science and the internet and real world graph problems.

As Vice President of ICANN you are a major force for standardization in the internet. What are the benefits of standardized protocols and what are the major hurdles to getting everyone on board with a standard.

This question is insightful because it acknowledges a couple different works of Cerf's in standardizing interplanetary internet protocols, trying to ensure future generations can read our data, and his work in ICANN. It is intresting because it probes the need for standards in the internet but aknoledges that a standard may not be perfect.
