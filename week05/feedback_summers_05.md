# Week Five: Transport Layer

## Feedback for MIDN Summers Portfolio Week Four

1. Look at your partner's Portfolio "front page" (the root README.md). How does it compare to your Portfolio's front page?

- This front page is simple and to the point. Compared to mine there are less links but it is clear where I am and the relevant information I would need to navigate the portfolio.
- I thought it was interesting that your portfolio README included a link to your knoledge checks. I have not seen that on others portfolios.

2. Open your partner's submission for Week 4. Read your partner's Review Question answers. Do they answer the questions correctly? Could they be improved? Do their answers raise any questions? If so, ask these questions to your partner when leaving feedback.

- All of the answers appear to be correct and well addressed. For R15b I believe that a NAK will be sent but segment 90 will also be ACKd.
- These answers are good but maybe a little more explanation could flesh them out a little more, I really like what you did in P3.

3. Read your partner's Learning Goal Answers. Did you learn anything new from their answers? Do their answers raise even more questions? If so, you should tell them this in your feedback.

- I learned that the "big deal" with TCP is that it is connection oriented and provides reliable data transfer. This was an interesting note to add and I liked that it summarized your whole report.
- The only question I had is when you googled sliding window protocols if you found any other protocols that use sliding window besides GBN and SR.

4. Look at your partner's Lab writeup. How easy is it to read? Do they make clear the steps they took to complete the lab? Did they do anything that surprised you, in a good or bad way? Mention any of these things in your feedback.

- The deep dive was interesting but I don't think they are normally focused on a learning objective. Regardless, this was a very good investigation into the things we quickly went over in the book.
- I liked your mathmatical analysis of TCP numbers and the possible combinations. How could this impact the number of sequences for one TCP transaction.
- This lab/deep dive is well written with good headers and cited sources. The only thing I would add are some graphics/ markdown elements to make it more visually appealing.

### Be sure to leave a link to your issue in your Portfolio (for this week - Week 5!)
